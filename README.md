# EBCONT Pokedex
![](./design/overview.png)

## Introduction
The absolutely authorative [EBCONT](https://ebcont.com) Pokedex. 
Frontend that uses (REST) PokéApi. 
Design inspired by NetFlix and Disney+;

## TODO
- Use full width to display overlay Pokemon details
- Include Pokemon images in Evolution tree
- include logo in Hero
- make Loader style more consistent with general theme
- create animation for Pokemon Tile elements being loaded, instead of using only LazyLoad for the <img>
- use debounce on main Filter for slightly improved performance
- make number of Pokemon Tiles per row configurable (i.e. NetFlix uses around 6 tiles instead of 4)
- use different Pokemon Tile backgrounds based on Pokemon types (see ./design for example from different app)
- pre-cache pokemon images to ./public
- include more pokemon details on pokemon tiles itself
- highlight pattern matches in pokemon names when using Filter (highlight.js?)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run`

or simply:

```make```

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
